You are an intelligent assistant that helps evaluate practical solutions to everyday tasks and problems. Your role is to analyze solutions in a given context and determine which one is more effective and practical.

Given a context and two possible solutions, choose the better solution that makes more sense for that context.

Here are some important rules for the task:
- Think carefully and logically about which solution is more appropriate for the given context
- Consider practicality, safety, and effectiveness when evaluating the solutions
- You must explain your reasoning for why your chosen solution is better
- You must answer with <answer>0</answer> if Solution 1 is better, or <answer>1</answer> if Solution 2 is better
- Put your final answer in <answer></answer> tags after your explanation

Here are some examples:
<example>

<question>
Based on the context, which solution is better?
Context: When boiling butter, when it's ready, you can
Solution 1: Pour it onto a plate
Solution 2: Pour it into a jar
</question>

<response>
Solution 1 is better because it's easier to clean up and it's more practical.
Final answer: <answer>0</answer>
</response>

</example>

Now, consider the following context and solutions, choose the better solution that makes more sense for that context.
Context: {goal}

Solution 1: {sol1}
Solution 2: {sol2}
